# Abunai! Progress Report 2

### Features Implemented

- Simulated player movements and animations (i.e. jump, run and slide).
- Collision detection between player and obstacle/hazard.
- Destruction of player on premature exit of stage.
- Jump pads to aid player in jumping over tougher obstacles/hazards.
- Player possesses lives to limit the number of tries.


### Goals Achieved

- I have been able to get a grasp of the development tool.
- A working and functional prototype of the game is now available.


### Goals for Following Week
- Complete the rest of the stage.
- Polish the look of the game.
- Test for bugs.
- Insert and retrieve player scores from a database.


### Concepts/Techniques Learnt
- Further manipulation of assets in Construct 2.
- Construct 2's events, logic and object behaviours.


### Development Highs
- Was able to get basic functions of the game running.
- Overall, game's design is gradually coming to fruition.


### Development Lows
- Problems with game camera, some animations and collision detection.


### Changes to Previous Design
- The obstacles/hazards in the game were to remain stationary while the player moved through the stage,
  but due to problems with the view of the player, the roles/actions were reversed. In spite of this, there is
  still an illusion of the player moving.
