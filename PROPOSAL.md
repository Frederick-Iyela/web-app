# Abunai!

Abunai! is a simple game in which the user must avoid obstacles in order to clear the stage/game.
As the player's character moves across the level, the only form of control the player has is to either jump above or duck under the obstacles.


### Features

- Player's character can jump over or slide underneath obstacles.
- Scores will be kept as to how long the player survives the stage.
- The number of attempts to complete the stage may also be recorded.
- Top three scores or three lowest number of attempts will be recorded, so the player can attempt to break his or her personal records.
